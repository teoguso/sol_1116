# This folder contains the bare minimum bunch of 
# files required to run a calculation for bulk 
# silicon, as seen in
# Guzzo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 166401, 2011
# Guzzo et al., Eur. Phys. J. B, 85 9 (2012) 324. 
# This includes a self-energy and output file 
# from an abinit GW calculation,
# a cs800.dat file (cs=electron Cross Section 
# (only s and p for the time being), 
# xxx=photon energy [eV]) and 
# other files with auxiliary information that 
# should be possible to retrieve entirely from 
# the .out file, by using awk, sed, grep 
# and the likes. 
# NOTE: the csxxx.dat file is ignored if 
# penergy = 0 in invar.in
# Now just try this: $ ../../spectral.py
